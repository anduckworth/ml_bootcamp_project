#Analyzing the past 1000 Web Scraped Tweets from key cryptocurrency influencers in comparison with Bitcoin closing prices from inception
##Mala Sharma, George Mihalopoulos, Alex Narvaez-Duckworth


## Proposal / Hypothesis<br> Our goal was to web scrape significant twitter accounts in order to see what sentiment is displayed by these figures throughout the recent market cycle. Through our analysis we tried to determine whether this sentiment coincides with a change in the overall trend of the market.

### Question 1<br> Why did we choose to only analyze the Twitter accounts of influencers from the cryptocurrency sphere? Why didn't we analyze subreddits and niche Facebook posts? 

### Response <br> Twitter is the most accessible platform for cryptocurrency leading influencers to carry the most sway over the mass market. Tweets were also the easiest form of media for us to access a variety of opinions simultaneously for natural language processing.

### Question 2<br> Why did we decide to perform a close read of the Bitcoin closing prices and not any other coins (i.e. dogecoin & ethereum)?

### Response <br>Bitcoin is a major currency in the crypto market that has the most prevalence outside of the niche cryptosphere with widely recognizable supporters such as Elon Musk of Tesla company and Miami mayor Francis Suarez proposing to pay workers in Bitcoin.
